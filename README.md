# IntelliDark
IntelliDark: An intelligent dark theme for the internet!
## TODO
  * Handle background images that do not fill element
  * Improve MutationObserver efficiency
  * Initial inversion with filter
  * Test Text-Shadow
  * Support SVGs; Invert fill
  * Debug Image Inversion
  * Handle Pseudo Classes (hover, active, etc.)
  * Handle Pseudo Elements through getComputedStyle

Work on extension has been halted as DarkReader has implemented a Dynamic theme generator similar to the end goals of this project. Work on this project will resume if there are obvious fautls in the leading dark theme gemerating extension that can be resolved by IntelliDark. Competition for the sake of competition benefits nobody.
